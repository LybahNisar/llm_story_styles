--- POETRIC ---
In the quiet of the dawn, there stands a girl,  
Her name is Laiba, in a world that twirls.  
With dreams like stars, she dances through the day,  
A spirit so bright, lighting up the way.  

Her laughter rings like chimes in the breeze,  
In gardens of hope, where joy finds ease.  
With every step, she weaves a tale,  
Of courage and grace, where hearts prevail.  

In the tapestry of life, she plays her part,  
With kindness and love, she conquers the heart.  
Oh, Laiba, a girl with a spirit so free,  
A beacon of light for all who can see.
